# Regularization
Implemented from scratch regularized linear regression to study different bias-variance properties

In the first half of the exercise, I implemented regularized linear regression to predict 
the amount of water flowing out of a dam using the change of water level in a reservoir. 
In the next half, I went through some diagnostics of debugging learning algorithms
and examine the effects of bias v.s. variance.
